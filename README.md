# AirBnB Hack
* Using [inside airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com)  we look at the data on airbnb in Paris.
* For predictive modelling we use a Gradient Boosted Regression method - with tools from partial dependence.
* We build some simple models and do some Topic extraction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
