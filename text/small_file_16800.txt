Immeuble dans lequel a vécu Victor Hugo Tout le quartier porte l'empreinte des travaux de l'époque du baron Haussmann. Malgré de grandes modifications architecturales, le quartier a conservé la particularité de posséder de nombreux théâtres, mais aussi d'être le lieu d'une importante activité commerciale avec la présence de grands magasins et de boutiques. Cette petite rue avait été ouverte par Louis-Philippe en 1845 en l'honneur de la bataille d'Isly au Maroc, à cause des problèmes de circulation pour accéder au quartier commerçant. La rue de l'Isly s'inscrit dans cet ensemble, tout spécialement l'immeuble qu'habita Victor Hugo, car il a conservé l'architecture et le style qu'il avait à l'époque. Il s'agit donc d'un immeuble de type haussmannien en pierre de taille, haut de quatre étages

It has a dining table, 1 small bathroom/toilet and a proper, fully equipped kitchen. It can accommodate 2 persons easily. Since the room has another sofa bed, so it is extremely convenient to have additional 2 people, but the room can get too stuffy and crowded.	What I love most about my home? The location!  In addition to that, the room has minimal decor and is equipped with all one needs to have a happy stay in a Parisian building.

Minus the wardrobe, the whole apartment is accessible. You may even use the kitchen with prior permission because usually all the groceries are locked up. I'm available on mobile/email at all times. If you'd like more local information on what to do, where to stay and how to get to the place of choice, I would be happy to help. The best part of my studio? The location!.
