It is 50 meters away from the 'Montmartre' pedestrian street and 2 minutes away from Montorgueil with its shops and cafes. This is the best place to stroll around! I'm working in a travel agency, and I'm in charge of building tours in Paris and around, so I can say that I have a good knowledge of my city! I'll be happy to give you some tips on the places you shouldn't miss and some good restaurants and bars if you're interested. Moreover, you'll have access to guides and books that you'll be free to consult. Really everything is a few minutes away from the apartment.

Metro Sentier is the closest, but Chatelet-Les Halles is 5 minutes walk from the apartment.

Guests would have access to everything. I try not to bother, I would see my guests to give them the keys and take them back, but sometimes I am not even there and I arrange it otherwise. Guests can call me at any time or whatsapp me, I will always do my best to help them if they have any problem or if they need any information. I like it when guests feel like home.  The thing I like the most about my neighbourhood is that it is so well located that I never need to take public transports. I can do my life within 200 meters, the best clubs, restaurants and bars are in the area. Pe
